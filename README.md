# Assembly

This repository contains my projects from University, in which we followed the Nand2Tetris coursework to create our own computer "hardware" and "software". I have left the credits
to the program in the initial comments of each file. 

The Gates folder contains all logic gates, or chips, neccessary to run the computer's CPU.
